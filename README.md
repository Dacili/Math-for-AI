## 1. Algebra
- **Exponents** - An exponent refers to the number of times a number is multiplied by itself. For example, 2 to the 3rd (2^3) means: 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.

- **Radicals** - The √ symbol that is used to denote square root or nth roots.  
  **Radicand** - A number or expression inside the radical symbol

- **Factorials** - operation of multiplying any natural number with all the natural numbers that are smaller than it. Factorial is used for questions that ask you to find how many ways you can arrange or order a set number of things.

- **Summations** - summation is the addition of a sequence of numbers, called addends or summands; the result is their sum or total.

**Closed form** -  an expression or equation is in closed form if it is formed with constants, variables and a finite set of basic functions connected by arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, /, and integer powers) and function composition. Commonly, the allowed functions are nth root, exponential function, logarithm, and trigonometric functions.
